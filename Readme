Build Your IPFIRE ROUTER in A pc fully Dockerize

To configure the router please read how to a router works. 
there is a port for wan connection and another port for lan, wan or multiple lan port, DMZ connection for webserver.
docker takes bridge network but for router we will connect host interface to router with out using bridge 
I have tested docker in my local pc with two interface. and same driver and interface ip set to settings file.
please check the file and change it to as per your network connection 
check your pc also stop all services like a fresh install os with docker only
